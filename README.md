# 🖥️ p10k-config

This repository contains my customized [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) Zsh theme configuration, designed for a modern terminal experience with features like OS icons, date and time on separate lines, transparency-friendly colors, and a minimalist clean layout.

> ⚡ Optimized for Kali Linux (WSL), but works across all Linux distros.

## 📦 Dependencies

Before using this config, ensure the following are installed:

### 1. Zsh (if not already)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh -y
```

Set Zsh as your default shell:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Logout and log back in to apply.

---

### 2. (Optional) Oh My Zsh

**Oh My Zsh is not required** to use Powerlevel10k or this configuration. However, if you prefer a plugin framework, Oh My Zsh offers an easy way to manage themes and plugins.

> ⚠️ If you already have a customized `.zshrc` (with aliases, plugins, or settings), installing Oh My Zsh will **overwrite** it. Make sure to back up your config before installing:

```bash
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
```

Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

---

### 3. Powerlevel10k

#### ✅ With or without Oh My Zsh

Clone the Powerlevel10k theme:

* **If using Oh My Zsh:**

  ```bash
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git \
    ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
  ```

  Then set this in `~/.zshrc`:

  ```bash
  ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
  ```

* **If NOT using Oh My Zsh:**

  ```bash
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
  ```

  Then at the very top of your `~/.zshrc`, add:

  ```bash
  source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme
  ```

---

## 🚀 Installation (This Configuration)

### 1. Clone the Config

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robel-S-Y/p10k-config.git
cd p10k-config
```

### 2. Copy the Config File

```bash
cp p10k.zsh ~/.p10k.zsh
```

### 3. Source the Config in `.zshrc`

Ensure your `~/.zshrc` contains this line:

```bash
[[ -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] && source ~/.p10k.zsh
```

Add it manually at the end of the file if it's missing.

---

### 4. Reload Zsh

Apply the changes by restarting your terminal or running:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
